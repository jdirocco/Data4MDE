                <div class="well">Jesús Sánchez Cuadrado is a Ramón y Cajal researcher at Universidad de Murcia. Previously, he was an associate professor at Universidad Autónoma de Madrid. His research has been focused on Model-Driven Engineering topics, notably model transformation languages and domain-specific languages. On these topics, he has created several tools which are available at <a href="http://github.com/jesusc">http://github.com/jesusc</a>. Lately, he has been involved in the construction of the MAR search engine. For more information please visit <a href="http://sanchezcuadrado.es">http://sanchezcuadrado.es</a>.</div>

                <div class="well text-justify">The availability of curated collections of models is essential for the application of techniques like Machine Learning and Data Analytics to MDE as well as to boost research activities which are currently limited to small datasets. However, discovering and collecting public models is not an easy task since they are scattered through several services and repositories. In this talk I will present MAR (<a href="http://mar-search.org">http://mar-search.org</a>), a search engine for models which has collected and indexed more that 500.000 models of different types from several sources, including GitHub and GenMyModel. MAR provides an entry point to explore and use large collections of models for different use cases. I will explain how the architecture of MAR enables the effective processing of these models and the services that it offers. In the second part of the talk, I will discuss interesting applications of MAR, including the construction of datasets of models and their usage to apply machine learning to address modelling tasks.</div>
