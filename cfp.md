# The Data4MDE workshop will be postponed to STAF 2021.
#### Scope

Data is a precious resource and is the most important part of all applications like Data Analytics, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence. Without qualitative data, there is no training phase and all the modern research will go in vain. In Model-Driven Engineering (MDE), like any discipline, data are crucial to perform any research activity. The researcher spends time and effort to create a suitable corpus of objects to answer specific research questions. 

The need for data is the mission that Data4MDE aims to solve.  In particular,  we are looking for papers that describe how the data are collected, how the dataset can be reused in other research, and how interested researchers can contribute to maintain and improve the dataset. The purpose of Data4MDE is to provide a forum with the aim to share and discuss the datasets for MDE. A well-defined corpus of data enables many research activities: reproducible experiments, adoption of learning-based approaches, analytics, model analysis and testing. 

#### Topics
The workshop aims to attract and offer a space for different kinds of datasets around MDE research. MDE Data Showcase papers should describe datasets that are curated by their authors and made available to use by others. In our envision, we are searching for datasets that should be of value to others in the community. The context where the dataset has been used, the sources and the methodology are key aspects to foster their reuse. We are looking for papers that even describe the data in terms of structures, API, supporting tools, and schema.  It may help other researchers to enlarge and refine the dataset. Themes that are of particular interest to Data4MDE  also include: i) the description of the originality of the data set, ii) privacy,  licenses, and ethical aspects, iii) an aggregated and statistical view of the data, iv) the identified issues and limitation in creating the data collection,  and v) manual activities and human added knowledge and reasoning.
We are looking for any possible datasets consisting of the MDE artifacts, for instance:

* collection of models and modelling language definitions, in any syntax and semantics,
* model transformations,
* collected answers from research questionnaires,
* model-based logging manipulation,
* model workbenches,
* operational-based models,
* Big-Models,
* model refactoring collections,
* modeling notations for describing the dataset,
* supporting tools to query, search and filter the data,
* concrete examples of  modeling artifact evolution, and
* metric reports.
 
 The Data4MDE would be looking mainly for papers describing datasets of MDE artifacts, which should be made freely available by the authors.
  
#### Please submit your proposals [here](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=data4mde2020).

Submission guidelines. We solicit data showcase papers (**max. 5 pages**): contributions on topics of the workshop presenting novel MDE dataset.
The submissions must be in English and adhere to the Springer LNCS style.
The papers must be associated with the dataset that should be made available at the time of submission of the paper for review. We are encouraging to publish the dataset in a dedicate Github https://github.com repository or in Zenodo https://zenodo.org, an open-access repository that can provide a digital object identifier (DOI).

Contributions will be handled with EasyChair and will be peer reviewed by at least 3 PC members. 
All submissions must be original work and must not have been previously published or being under review elsewhere. For each accepted paper, at least one of the authors must register for the workshop, participate fully in the workshop, and present the paper at the workshop. Accepted workshop papers will be published on CEUR-WS.

#### Important dates.
