#Abstract Section
abstractTitle: "Abstract"
abstractBody: "Data is a precious resource and is the most important part of all applications like Data Analytics, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence. Without qualitative data, there is no training phase and all the modern research will go vain. In Model-Driven Engineering (MDE), like any discipline, data is crucial to perform any research activity. MDE researchers spend time and effort to create suitable corpus of objects to answer specific research questions. The selection of an adequate corpus of data often requires intense, tedious, and manual activities.  MDE adoption is taking advantage of the growth of the integration of Machine Learning (ML) techniques into domain modeling. Empirical analyses, data analytics, and ML algorithms perform better as much as they can learn commonalities over massive datasets. Considering the above information, the need for data is a challenging issue that affects any researcher in their career. This can be brought to the modeling world where data are modeling artifacts. A place to discuss relevant MDE datasets should promote their reuse, even the enhancement, and new possible collaborations between researchers. Data4MDE aims to share and discuss identified MDE datasets enabling research in the field of analytics, reuse, model analysis, testing, learning-based approaches, and many other connected fields."

We realize that this is pretty short notice so we hope you can help us spread the word! There will be pizza, prizes and a great group of geeks to spend the evening coding with! Even if you don't have an app idea come on in and lend a hand to someone else or maybe find inspiration once you're here!"}
 - {title: "Google Glass", image: "hackathon-1.png", details: "We love wearable computing especially Google Glass for which we want to gather the break up community in order to boost innovation.<br><br>Coding an app on Google Glass needs its Rockstar Dev : the team needs a fast learner with solid skills on Android. He knows his way around Android SDK, already checked the Glass Developement Kit (GDK) quick start guide allowing him to jump start developing an app for Glass.The Designer has the hard task to build the visual identity from the ground up, he has strong UX knowledge and a deep understanding of the new rules set by the Glass. His design skills give him the credibility to decide the most effective UI and the most compelling Glass experience."}
 - {title: "Polymer", image: "hackathon-2.png", details: "Polymer is a library that introduces web components. Web components are small elements on a page that can be extended and incorporated in web applications. The result is an increase in productivity.<br><br>We used Polymer mainly to explore the concept of web components. The transition of Google to material design was also a factor.While the library was never touched by the team, it still was painless to wireframe the application. Later on we incorporated some Polymer components in the design. We didn’t use the full potential of Polymer because of the limited time."}
